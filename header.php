In our 25 years of experience, each party in probate litigation will pay an average of $15,000-$20,000 to fight their case. A small percentage of cases cost less than $15,000, some as little as $5,000. And a small percentage of cases cost more than $20,000, much more. But approximately 70% to 80% of cases cost each party in the range of $15,000 to $20,000.                                    </p>                                    <p>                                        Keep in mind that a good attorney will always be less expensive than “bulldog” attorneys. Bulldog-type attorneys always and unnecessarily drive up costs. A good attorney is tough, but knows how to effectively resolve cases, while efficiently keeping litigation costs as low as possible.                                    </p>                                </div>                                <h4>Do you take fees on contingency?</h4>                                <p>No. Further, we do not know of one competent attorney who does probate litigation on a contingency fee basis.</p>                                <p>Probate litigation is not personal injury litigation.

There is no study proving that no contest clauses actually work in preventing inheritance conflicts. Further, judges reject no contest clauses in over 80% of the cases involving no contest clauses. Do not be deterred by a no contest clause. We routinely and quickly slice through a no-contest clause. If you have a good case, the no contest clause will fail under Utah law.                                </div>                                <h4>Do you represent trustees and executors?</h4>                                <div>                                    <p>Yes.

Inheritance fraud is any attempt to dishonestly take assets belonging to a benefactor.                                </div>                                <h4>What is undue influence?</h4>                                <div>                                    Undue influence occurs when a manipulator attempts to override another person’s desires and replace the other person’s desires with the manipulator’s desires. Undue influence is difficult to prove (mere allegations are inadequate, even though they may be based in fact). But we have successfully won cases based on proven undue influence.                                </div>                                <h4>What is mental incapacity?</h4>                                <div>                                    <p>The Utah Probate Code (§ 75-1-201(22)) and the Utah Uniform Power of Attorney Act (§ 75-9-102(5)), define mental incapacity generally as follows:</p>                                    A person is mentally incapacitated if their ability to                                    <ul>                                        <li>receive and evaluate information;</li>                                        <li>make and communicate decisions; or</li>                                        <li>provide for necessities such as food, shelter, clothing, health care, or safety</li>                                    </ul>                                    <p>is impaired, such that the person is unable, even with technological assistance, to safely and appropriately protect themselves and conduct their affairs.</p>                                </div>                                <h4>What about second spouses?</h4>                                <div>                                    In our experience, second spouses or issues involving second spouses are one of the most common causes of inheritance conflicts in probate litigation. It is unfortunate that most individuals when marrying a second time dramatically fail in dozens of ways to preempt inheritance conflicts: to protect themselves, their second spouse, and their children from their first marriage. We represent both second spouses and children from first marriages.                                </div>                            </div>                        </div>                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">                            <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">                                <iframe class="embed-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wlmedNGrFWg" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe>                            </div>                        </div>                        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 hidden-xs hidden-sm">                            <?php get_template_part('template-parts/side-banner');
